# Drum Machine 
App functionality is based on ` user stories ` from [freeCodeCamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine).

# Motivation
My main goal while building this app was to practice following skills:
- React, React Hooks:
   - Playing sound
   - Changing app behavior based on button state 
   - Keyboard events
